    I've added two more variations - this time focussing on Kubernetes

Building on my recent Web App variations work, I've added two more. They're both
based in Kubernetes (K8S) as it's a platform in which I've been actively developing my understanding.

Take a look at `Web App Variations <https://github.com/dedickinson/webapp-variations>`_ on GitHub, try some variations, and let me know what you think.
