About
=====

This blog is somewhere I place ideas and some dev outputs as/when I get time.

I've written a couple of books:

* `The Groovy 2 Tutorial <https://leanpub.com/groovytutorial>`_
* `Groovy Succinctly <https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/groovy_succinctly>`_

Social media isn't really my thing but I am on `LinkedIn <http://www.linkedin.com/in/dedickinson>`_ if you'd like to drop me a line. I always appreciate it when people add a brief message to their Connect request.

This site is built with `Pelican <https://www.getpelican.com/>`_ and makes use of `Bootstrap <https://getbootstrap.com/>`_.
