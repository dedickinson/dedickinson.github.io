| For many years I've kept notebooks to track development prototypes and various explorations into new (for me) software. I find this approach really quite useful as it keeps a record of the code and notes I found useful whilst in the thick of a challenge. Often, trying to work out how to do something is more like a puzzle to me than "work" and can soak up many hours of my attention.

The various entries in my notebooks are variable - some of it reaches a conclusion that could be run by others whilst others are quick scripts. I happily admit that I start a lot of things but, due to time or low returns, I drop it and move on. Interestingly, this type of approach can pay off a little time later when a team I'm working with starts to look into a solution and I can trawl up something from a notebook. With easily accessible (and free) systems like GitHub and BitBucket, I can stash the code for easy recall.
An example is my `engineering-notebook <https://github.com/dedickinson/engineering-notebook>`__ repo on GithHub or my recent play with `Jupyter and Spark <https://bitbucket.org/duncan_dickinson/spark-workbench>`__. For the more tangible work, I decided to setup `a notebook site <http://notebook.duncan.dickinson.name/>`__ and put an overview together to describe some of my efforts.
