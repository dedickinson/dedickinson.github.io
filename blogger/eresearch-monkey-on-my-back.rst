| Many years ago I was studying an MTeach/MEd, having dropped out of full-time coding and into full-time study. I lived in a share house and owned a vintage Dell laptop. Having done my BIT I admit that I never used the Library and did almost no written assignments. Studying education called on me to access articles, read them and try to turn them into a paper. Sometimes I even had to undertake observations. Most of the "research" was qualitative.
| So, armed with a stack of highlighted papers I drew up (paper) concept maps and started to flesh out a piece. I used emacs and LaTeX with BibTeX in that first year - it was fun but really relied heavily on my technical background to keep it afloat. For my MEd I had a newer PC so gave EndNote a go. By the time I'd set it up to understand that APA should mention that the article was on the web, I'd left that product.
| Now, I don't pretend that my heady coursework days can match your 5 year research effort - nuh-uh. But what I can say is that, if I nearly threw my laptop across the room just trying to create 5000 words, I can only imagine how a doctorate feels.
| There has to be a better way. Really.
| It also has to be made better for people not hitting the whoa-o-meter with their project. That's people like educators and historians. In fact anyone whose research requires them to collate data that amounts to something less than a large European dodgem circuit. It really seems that, if you're not munching PetaBytes, no-one wants to share your lunch. University ICT teams give you just enough storage to hold a picture of your cat and many eResearch data people are looking for that bigger bang.
| So you store all your data on your laptop and a few disks and roll the dice.
| `Investigating Data Management Practices in Australian Universities <http://eprints.qut.edu.au/14549/>`__ and `The Next Generation of Academics <https://urresearch.rochester.edu/retrieve/15430/Report+to+Public+on+Grad+Student+User+Research.pdf>`__ really showed me some truths:

-  Researchers don't have time to play with their computers and eResearch tools: they just want them to work
-  Researchers aren't catalogers: they don't want to create comprehensive metadata for everything they're reading/watching/creating.
-  Researchers don't run data centres: they want institutional storage and backup so that they don't have to think about it.
-  Researchers (often) work in teams: let them share
-  If your eResearch idea will create more administrative work for researchers, go back to the drawing board. I hope repository admins are listening.
-  It's not about the software - it's about the research getting done.

| So, whilst at QUT we worked really hard to integrate our ePrints data collection into the Research Master (HERDC) data collection. This essentially sought to stop doubled-up administrivia. Putting your data into ePrints actually also meant you were largely killing two birds. I really hope this work has been effective. I also really hope that the stand-alone job of submitting to an IR will become as forgotten as the night cart.
| So there's a lot of work to be done to create software that helps rather than hinders and workflows that flow, rather than fail.
| Leaving the ramble here - ready to hone these ideas into the `Desktop eResearch Revolution <http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/05/desktop-eresearch-revolution.htm/trackback>`__
