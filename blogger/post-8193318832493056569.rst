| Suggestion: Two steps.
| 1. Bring it all together using The Fascinator so at least people SEEKING info can find stuff.
| 2. Add editing / annotation etc tools to The Fasciantor using widgets etc that are as arms-length as possible and route the changes back to the source systems. This is kind if what we will need to do on the desktop anyway.
