| I've just kicked off my `Workbench blog <http://workbench.duncan.dickinson.name/>`__ with a post about setting up a diagnostic HTTP server. I've rounded up a number of coding items I've been doing and aim to get a post describing each one - perhaps you can use them in your work.
| If you look at the web version of this blog you'll see a link to Workbench and also Steam - a web album for me to share various locomotive and industrial miscellany.
| Lastly, if you ever want to contact me, `Twitter <http://twitter.com/dedickinson>`__ and `LinkedIn <http://www.linkedin.com/in/dedickinson>`__ are good starting points.
