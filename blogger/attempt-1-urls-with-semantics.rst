| Having read Peter Sefton's `Journal 2.0 <http://ptsefton.com/2009/04/08/journal-20-embedding-semantics-in-documents.htm/trackback>`__ post, I thought I'd have a play and create a basic URL encoder for such information. The result is the `semant-o-matic <http://duncan.dickinson.name/semanto/index.php>`__ and it's basic but a start.
| Excuse the poor formatting - I just wanted to have a play with some code (I get only rare chances).
