| After beefing it up a little, Peter Sefton and I had our Open Repositories 2010 paper published to the Journal of Digital Information (JoDI). Check it out at \ http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/1766/2165. I now need to start getting our OR 2011 paper ready for submission!
| **Abstract**
| The organizers of the 5th International Conference on Open Repositories list nine polar dichotomies that represent “The Grand Integration Challenge” for the repository community/movement. In this paper we take up the challenge. We do so in the context of a our work to build infrastructure for the academy in general, with the goal to develop a modular 'Academic Working Environment' (AWE) which encompasses both teaching and learning on one hand and research on the other. Repositories and the ecosystem of services and workflows that surround them play a key role in this emerging system.
