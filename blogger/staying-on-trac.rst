| I admit it - I am growing tired of Trac wiki. It's probably our fault - we're using an old version - but I get the feeling it's a bigger problem than that. I work with a University-based technology team that tries to keep the following things together:

-  Organisational news and info
-  Project information
-  Source code
-  Job Tickets
-  Server details
-  Documentation
-  Publications
-  Procedures and Policy

| 
| We've got a range of skills on our team but obscure wiki markup format is not necessarily a precondition of employment. What's more, we've ended up with several sites running Trac or ICE that makes learning where to put stuff rather onerous.
| My thought is to start trying to bring this stuff together but the question is how. In a previous job I created a controlled vocabulary within Confluence Wiki to bring together reports and project info but source code didn't really come into the equation. XWiki might be a good open alternative but there'd be some coding to do.
| I've also been picking up on Maven and see that it could provide a good basis for the coding side of things but that doesn't help non-technical staff.
| For presenting the content we could use The Fascinator to harvest from all of our sources and present (mash) it in a variety of combinations (public, developer or manager). That still leaves us with lots of entry points.
| So I have some leads but nothing solid (yet). Ideas welcome.
